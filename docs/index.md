# Document Your Application Here

VIP encourages you to document your application in Markdown. This is a great way of keeping your documentation up to date with what the application actually does.

You can create new Markdown files in this `docs/` directory for each important part of your application.

## Examples

For example, you might have:
- `docs/local.md` that describes how to run your application locally
- `docs/REST.md` that describes any custom endpoints that your application has
- `docs/syndication.md` might describe how syndication works between subsites in your application
- `docs/build.md` describes what parts of your application gets built into the final deployable application
- `docs/qa.md` describes any manual or automated QA tests and processes that you have run on your application prior to deployment.
- etc.

## Benefits

Not only does this help you onboard your new engineers, it also helps VIP support staff to understand the moving parts or complexities of your application better at a glance, without having to dig into the code.
